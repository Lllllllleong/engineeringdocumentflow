#          PERMISSIONS SETUP SCRIPT FOR DOCUMENT PROCESSING PIPELINE

#
# USAGE:
# 1. First, run `source ./scripts/setup_env.sh` to load project variables.
# 2. Then, run this script directly: `./scripts/setup_permissions.sh`
#
# WHAT IT DOES:
# 1. Creates the pipeline's central Service Account if it doesn't exist.
# 2. Grants the broad 'Editor' role to all necessary service accounts
#    to overcome common permission issues during development.
